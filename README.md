# globaldev Ruby Test

There are three components to this test.  There are no wrong answers,
and you can do as much or as little as you feel is appropriate.  Each
problem is contained within its own directory:

* `file-repo`: planning and architecture
* `one-million`: algorithms
* `proxy`: network coding

Please submit all your work by committing it to this repository and
pushing back here.  Work as you normally would, committing early and
often, so we can see the way your think and work.

Submit each problem's response within that problem's directory, and
please keep to git-friendly files (no nasty binary blobs).

Good luck!
