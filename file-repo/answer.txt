Build Ruby on Rails application
Using PostGres database (simplicity when deploying to Herkou)
Balsamiq etc (wireframes to plan style and feel for site)

Gems - 

Devise - to implement the authentication and authorisation for the users using an email address and password.
Cancancan - for permissions
Ransack - Searching
Carrierwave/paperclip - uploading/downloading assets
imageMagik - manipulation of images for downloads
rspec - for testing
pry-byebug - debugging
better-errors - debugging, more information and ability to test code in the browser

DB structure - 

Users - Devise arranges majority
Uploads - title, keywords, description, user_id, category_id, file_type
Categories - name, upload_id, user_id

Setting up of Rspec - allows for simple TDD

Models/Controllers/Views for - 

Users - 
Uploads - 
Categories - 

Associations in models - 

User - has_many uploads
Uploads - belongs_to users, has many categories
Categories - has many_uploads

Ransack to allow users to search for assets on title/category etc

Carrierwave/paperclip to allow users to upload images/files etc to the site and store in backend. Need to dynamically create links/buttons/forms to download the files depending on the file type. rails does this when rendering collections,

Asked some developers about storing different types of objects in the same table, single table inheritance was mentioned, might be solution, something I'm not familiar with at the moment so would need to research more. 

Form when uploading, selecting category, assigning name etc

Download form to allow user to input and select size of image downloaded

Gem like ImageMagik allows for resize of images, can be manipulated upon upload and download, download is more relevant given spec
